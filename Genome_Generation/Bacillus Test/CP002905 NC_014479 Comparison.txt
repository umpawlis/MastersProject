Operons with differences:
									(C)		(D)			   (A)                     (B)
Original Operon 1: [16S, 23S, 5S, Val_GUA, Thr_ACA, Lys_AAA, Leu_CUA, Gly_GGC, Leu_UUA,	Arg_CGU, Pro_CCA, Ala_GCA, 16S, 23S, 5S]
Original Operon 2: [16S, 23S, 5S, Asn_AAC, Thr_ACC, 				  Gly_GGC, 			Arg_CGU, Pro_CCA, Ala_GCA, 16S, 23S, 5S]
Ancestral Operon:  [16S, 23S, 5S, Val_GUA, Thr_ACA, 				  Gly_GGC, Leu_UUA, Arg_CGU, Pro_CCA, Ala_GCA, 16S, 23S, 5S]

(A) - Marked as duplication since found in another operon
(B) - Marked a deletion since there's no identical copy in the operon and we don't check other operons for gaps of size 1
(C) and (D) - Checked neighbor for substitution and codon mismatch and NC_014479's codon and substitution didn't match the neighbors so we kept CP002905's codon and gene


										(E)
Original Operon 1: 	[16S, 23S, 5S, Asn_AAC, Thr_ACC]
Original Operon 2: 	[16S, 23S, 5S				  ]
Ancestral Operon:	[16S, 23S, 5S]

(E) - Marked as duplicate since found in another operon


Self global alignment, Special Case - Cyclic Duplication:
Description: Two operons that are really good matches. however, neither of the operons have been paired
with the siblings operons. This indicates that the two operons are duplicates of each other. Additionally,
this indicates that a similar operon was lost in the sibling whereas the operon was duplicated in the sibling where it exists.
Therefore we will indicate the operon as a duplication in the sibling which the operon exists and we 
will indicate the operon was lost in the sibling where it is absent.
									(G)										  (F)
Original Operon 1: [Gly_GGC, Arg_CGU, Pro_CCA, Ala_GCA, 16S, 23S, 5S, Asn_AAC, Thr_ACC]   <------Target
Original Operon 2: [Gly_GGC, Arg_CGU, Pro_CCA, Ala_GCA, 16S, 23S, 5S				  ]   <------Source
(F) - Marked as duplication
(G) - Target is marked as duplicate since the target is a duplicate of the source, however we do not include Asn, and Thr since those are not part of the source originally
they must've been added after the whole operon was duplicated.
(H) Since we are assuming the operon was present in the ancestor and then during speciation in one of the descendants the operon was duplicated, therefore it had to be deleted in the other decedent
