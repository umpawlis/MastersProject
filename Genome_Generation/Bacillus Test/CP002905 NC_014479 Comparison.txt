Operons with differences:
									(C)						 (A)					(B)
Original Operon 1: 	[16S, 23S, 5S, Val_GUA, Thr_ACA, Lys_AAA, Leu_CUA, 	Gly_GGC, Leu_UUA, 	Arg_CGU, Pro_CCA, Ala_GCA, 16S, 23S, 5S]
Original Operon 2: 	[16S, 23S, 5S, Asn_AAC, Thr_ACC, 				  	Gly_GGC, 			Arg_CGU, Pro_CCA, Ala_GCA, 16S, 23S, 5S]
Ancestral Operon:	[16S, 23S, 5S, Val_GUA, Thr_ACA, 					Gly_GGC, Leu_UUA, 	Arg_CGU, Pro_CCA, Ala_GCA, 16S, 23S, 5S],

(A) - Detected as duplication because Lys_AAA, Leu_CUA were found in another operon
(B) - Labelled as deletion since we don't allow for gaps of size 1 to be checked in other operons and there is no matching gene within operon
(C) - Substitution detected. Since the same Substitution was not found when comparing to the neighbor with CP002905,  therefore Val_GUA inserted into ancestral operon and Asn was labeled as the Substitution

										 (D)
Original Operon 1: [16S, 23S, 5S, Asn_AAC, Thr_ACC]
Original Operon 2: [16S, 23S, 5S				  ]

(D) - Detected as duplication because gap was found in another operon
