Operons with differences:
														  (A)
Original Operon 1: [16S, 23S, 5S, Val_GUA, Thr_ACA, Lys_AAA, Leu_CUA, Gly_GGC, Leu_UUA, Arg_CGU, Pro_CCA, Ala_GCA, 16S, 23S, 5S]
Original Operon 2: [16S, 23S, 5S, Val_GUA, Thr_ACA, 				  Gly_GGC, Leu_UUA, Arg_CGU, Pro_CCA, Ala_GCA, 16S, 23S, 5S]
(A) - Gap found in another operon, therefore detected as a duplication

Self Global Alignment NC_000964                                                                                          
																														 (E)
Original Operon 1: [16S, 23S, 5S, Asn_AAC, Thr_ACC, 				  Gly_GGC, 			Arg_CGU, Pro_CCA, Ala_GCA, 16S, 23S, 5S, 16S, 23S, 5S]
Original Operon 2: [16S, 23S, 5S, Val_GUA, Thr_ACA, Lys_AAA, Leu_CUA, Gly_GGC, Leu_UUA, Arg_CGU, Pro_CCA, Ala_GCA, 			  	 16S, 23S, 5S]
									(F)		(G)			   (C)                    (D)                                    
Operon 1 was detected as a duplicate of Operon 2 therefore Operon 1 is the target and Operon 2 is the source.
(B) - Duplication of source, ie operon 2
(C) - Lys_AAA, Leu_CUA were deleted from the target
(D) - Leu_UUA were deleted from the target
(E) - 16S, 23S, 5S were detected as duplicates
(F) + (G) - Codon mismatch and substitution. We take the source's codon and gene therefore the codon mismatch and substitution is in the target.

Self Global Alignment Ancestor 3

Original Operon 1: [16S, 				   23S, 5S]
Original Operon 2: [16S, Ile_AUC, Ala_GCA, 23S, 5S]
							   (I)
Operon 1 was detected as the duplicate, therefore Operon 1 == target and Operon 2 == source
(H) - Source was duplicated and inserted into target's location
(I) - Ile_AUC, Ala_GCA were deleted from the target

Original Operon 1: [								Gly_GGC, 		  Arg_CGU, Pro_CCA, Ala_GCA, 16S, 23S, 5S]
Original Operon 2: [16S, 23S, 5S, Val_GUA, Thr_ACA, Gly_GGC, Leu_UUA, Arg_CGU, Pro_CCA, Ala_GCA, 16S, 23S, 5S]

Operon 1 was detected as the duplicate, therefore Operon 1 == target and Operon 2 == source
(J) - Duplication of source
(K) - 16S, 23S, 5S, Val_GUA, Thr_ACA were deleted from target
(L) - Leu_UUA deleted from target
