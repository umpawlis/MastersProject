Looking at the output in the console, global alignment found 17 orthologs with no differences between them, ie no gaps.

Orthologous operons with gaps:
Operon CP002905: 	[16S, 23S, 5S, Val_GUA, Thr_ACA, Lys_AAA, Leu_CUA, Gly_GGC, Leu_UUA, Arg_CGU, Pro_CCA, Ala_GCA, 16S, 23S, 5S]
Operon NC_014479: 	[16S, 23S, 5S, Asn_AAC, Thr_ACC, 				  Gly_GGC, 			Arg_CGU, Pro_CCA, Ala_GCA, 16S, 23S, 5S]

Gaps: ['Lys_AAA', 'Leu_CUA'], ['Leu_UUA']

We can see there was a substitution in the alignment and a codon mismatch in the alignment, Asn_AAC 20(A) and Val_GUA 17(A) are the Substitution
And Thr_ACA 18(B) and Thr_ACC 21(B) are the codon mismatch

Now for the gaps:
The gap ['Lys_AAA', 'Leu_CUA'] were found in another operon in the exact same order therefore these two genes were marked as duplicates.
Lys_AAA 19, Leu_CUA 20; (C)

The gap ['Leu_UUA'] is of size 1 therefore we will not check the other operons if this gene exists b/c it would most
certainly find a copy. We only allow for gaps of size 1 to be scanned within the alignment itself and since there's
no match therefore it's marked as a deletion and since it's present in CP002905 therefore the gene must've been deleted
from NC_014479's operon therefore the deletion will be in the NC_014479 but the index will refer to CP002905.
Leu_UUA 22; (D)

Next Orthologous operon with gaps:

Operon CP002905: 	[16S, 23S, 5S, Asn_AAC, Thr_ACC]
Operon NC_014479:	[16S, 23S, 5S				   ]

Gaps: ['Asn_AAC', 'Thr_ACC']

Again these two genes were found in another operon therefore they were marked as duplicates.
Asn_AAC 32, Thr_ACC 33; (E)

After the global alignment completes we still have two operons remaining in CP002905 that were not mapped to anything. Let's take a look at those:

1st Operon:
Target:	[Gly_GGC, Arg_CGU, Pro_CCA, Ala_GCA, 16S, 23S, 5S, Asn_AAC, Thr_ACC]
Source: [									 16S, 23S, 5S, Asn_AAC, Thr_ACC]

Gaps: ['Gly_GGC', 'Arg_CGU', 'Pro_CCA', 'Ala_GCA']

As we can see the genes in the gap list exist in the target but not in the source, therefore these genes must have come another source therefore
they were marked as duplicates.

Gly_GGC 34, Arg_CGU 35, Pro_CCA 36, Ala_GCA 37; (F)

Also we also specified that the Source had to be duplicated resulting in target therefore the following event had to occur:
16S 38, 23S 39, 5S 40, Asn_AAC 41, Thr_ACC 42; (G)


2nd Operon being handled by the self global alignment module:

Target: [Gly_GGC, Arg_CGU, Pro_CCA, Ala_GCA, 16S, 23S, 5S				   ]
Source:	[Gly_GGC, Arg_CGU, Pro_CCA, Ala_GCA, 16S, 23S, 5S, Asn_AAC, Thr_ACC]

Gaps: ['Asn_AAC', 'Thr_ACC']

We can see that 'Asn_AAC', 'Thr_ACC' are present in the target but not in the source therefore these had to be deleted from the target and since they
do not have an index in the target we means there's nothing to index, we put a -1.
!Asn_AAC -1, !Thr_ACC -1; (H)

Finally we have to indicate the Source was duplicated resulting in the target we place the following duplication event how ever since Asn_AAC and Thr_ACC
are not present in the target, they would have an index of -1.

[Gly_GGC, Arg_CGU, Pro_CCA, Ala_GCA, 16S, 23S, 5S, Asn_AAC, Thr_ACC] (I)
